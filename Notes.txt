Steps to Dockerize the Flask App:
1. Create a Dockerfile
Inside your project directory (ecom_express/), create a file named Dockerfile:

touch Dockerfile
Add the following content to your Dockerfile:

Dockerfile

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install Flask (and any other required Python packages)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir flask

# Expose the port that the Flask app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable for Flask to run in production mode
ENV FLASK_ENV=production

# Run the app when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]




3. Build and Run the Docker Image
To build and run your Dockerized Flask app, follow these steps:

Build the Docker Image: Run this command inside your project directory:


docker build -t flask-ecom-express .

This will build the Docker image and tag it as flask-ecom-express.

Run the Docker Container: After the image is built, you can run the container using:


docker run -d -p 5001:5001 flask-ecom-express

This command will:



http://localhost:5000



o push an image to your Docker Hub repository, follow these steps:

1. Login to Docker Hub
Log in to your Docker Hub account from your terminal using the following command:


docker login

2. Tag the Docker Image

docker tag <local_image_name> <dockerhub_username>/<repository_name>:<tag>

docker tag Ecom_app divyavundavalli/Ecom_app:latest

 docker tag flask-ecom-express-new anilkumarsahu2623/flask-ecom-express-new:latest


3. Push the Image
Once the image is tagged, push it to Docker Hub using the following command:


docker push <dockerhub_username>/<repository_name>:<tag>
docker push divyavundavalli/Ecom_app:latest



4. Verify the Image on Docker Hub
Go to your Docker Hub account, navigate to the repository, and check if the image has been uploaded successfully.




Jenkins:
docker run -d --name jenkins \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts

http://localhost:8080


docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
